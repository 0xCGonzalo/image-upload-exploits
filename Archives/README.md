## Archive path traversal

This section about simple vulnerability in handling archive files (ZIP, TAR, JAR, RAR, etc).
You can create any archive which includes files with path traversal attack vector. Depends on system

**Linux**
```
../../../../../../../../../../backdoor.php
```

**Windows**

```
..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\backdoor.php
```

So, if a web application extracts files to a temp directory, then when it tries to move the file with the attack vector, it will eventually move it to the specified path, simple as in a regular path traversal attack.

This attack has been known for a long time, but recently guys from Snyk [published a research](https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability), and they found about 20 archive libraries vulnerable for this attack. 

Exploitation depends on which application you attacking, sometimes you can extract files in PHP web application root directory and execute it. But you need to know it's system path. Also, the vulnerability can be not only in web applications, sometimes in some desktop or mobile applications it is possible to view archives directly in the application, for example, in instant messengers.

Tool to create archive with attack vector:
[evilarc](https://github.com/ptoomey3/evilarc.git) 

There is some exploits to test attack, just copy from [original repo](https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability/tree/master/archives). 
If application is vulnerable then it will extract evil.txt to a **/tmp** or **\TEMP** directory.
